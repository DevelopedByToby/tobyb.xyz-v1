  Hello! Welcome to my personal website
  </h1>

Hello there, this is the code of my personal website!

It was built with html and css and I hope it help you build yours!

The main branch is protected, so to make changes you do have to submit a PR. Please keep in mind, all changes made to this repo DO NOT get uploaded to the main site. I will have to do a full review of them, then the code will be added to the private repo.

****IMPORTANT! If you use this code as a template for your own work (which is totally fine by the way) please mention this repo, and also make sure to send it to me.  I would love to see some other people's work! If you have any concernes about this or anything else to do with this repo, please <a href="mailto:toby@tobyb.xyz">email me</a> :)****

Changes are being made in a private repository! That repostitory does have to stay private because of the access it has to my website. It may potentially go public, but all changes I make to it that I seem suitable to add to this repo will be added! ðŸ˜€ 

Also! I will try to keep you all as updated as possible in the MD file, please check back here for updates! 

visit is <a href="https://tobyb.xyz">here!</a> :)

This website has been completely programmed by me.
