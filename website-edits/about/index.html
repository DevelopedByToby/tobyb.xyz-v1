    <p>Hi, I'm Toby. I'm a 12 year old full <br> stack web developer.
         I'm interested <br>in everything to do with tech, from <br>programming to building computers.<br>
         <p>
        I started programming when I was only<br> 7 years old, and I built my first computer<br> at only 10 years old. Over the past few <br>
        years, I've gradually gotten more and more<br> interesed in all sorts of different projects, <br>tools and languages! <p>
            Recently, I've been really interested in<br> open source programming and I've been<br> helping loads of people with their own projects,<br> and I'd love to try and help you with yours.<br> So, lets <a href="mailto:toby@tobyb.xyz">talk</a>.</p>
